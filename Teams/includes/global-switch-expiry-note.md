 Tenant-level control for Teams was removed effective August 2018. Control access to Teams in your organization with user-level licensing. To learn more, see [Manage user access to Teams](../user-access.md).

The exception to this change is Microsoft Teams for Education (EDU). You can still manage Teams at the organization level if you have an EDU license. To do this, go to the Microsoft 365 admin center > **Settings** > **Services and add-ins** > **Microsoft Teams**. If you're using the new Teams admin center, you'll have to turn off **Try the new admin center** to find **Services and add-ins**.
